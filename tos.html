                Last Modified: January 29, 2020
                Welcome to Credit Starter’s website (the “Company Site”), owned and operated by Credit Starter, Inc. (“Company,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use the Company Site, and our services and software provided on or in connection with the services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, or clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” or something similar, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Company Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who register for or otherwise access the Service (“Users”).
                Certain services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time, and your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference.
                Please read this agreement carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. These Terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.
                1. Use of Our Service
                   1. Eligibility
                This is a contract between you and Company. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. You must be a resident of the United States with a United States mailing address. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Company.
                   2. Company Service and App
                Company Services include the following key features: (a) access to certain offers for financial products and services by third party financial institutions; and (b) reporting of data provided by you or third parties to credit reporting agencies. 
                The Company may report User Content (as defined below) by you or a third party to a credit reporting agency, which may assist in establishing a credit history and/or a credit score for the individual for whom the User Content relates. In order to use certain aspects of the Services, you will need to provide Company with certain information required by Company, including, personal information (name, email address, password, phone number, date of birth, social security number, addresses) about the individual for whom the User Content relates, information relating to the reporter of User Content and rental or bill payment information (amount due and payment dates) and any information necessary for Company to verify and validate the information. 
                Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Service. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Company Content (as defined below). Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.
                We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (the “App”). To use the App you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the App. Company does not warrant that the App will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the App and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. Company hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the App for one Company account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the App to any third party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that Company may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the App is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the App or any copy thereof, and Company or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the App (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in these Terms, is void. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted under these Terms. If the App is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. The App will be deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service. The App originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The App may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the App may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the App and the Service.
                   3. Company Accounts
                Your Company account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Company account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.
                You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information required by Company, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Company will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account. You will not activate multiple Company accounts without Company’s prior consent.
                By providing Company your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your settings. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.
                   4. User Information, Reporting and Credit Report Authorization
                We may permit you to submit personal or financial information related to you or your customers in order for Company to provide to third parties, including credit reporting agencies, and to use for its purposes (“User Content”). By submitting to Company User Content, you grant to Company and its affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable and transferable license to copy, publish, translate, modify, reformat, create derivative works from, distribute, reproduce, sell, display, transmit, publish, broadcast, host, archive, store, cache, use or otherwise exploit all or any portion of the User Content, in any commercial or noncommercial manner whatsoever, for any purposes that complies with applicable law with or without attribution and without further notice to you. Neither you, nor any other person or entity, will have the right to (i) receive any royalty or consideration of any kind for the use of the User Content pursuant to these Terms or (ii) inspect or approve the editorial copy or other material that may be used in connection with the User Content. 
                By submitting User Content to Company, you represent and warrant that (i) you own or control any and all rights in and to the User Content, and the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms, and if you are not the holder of such rights, the holder of such rights has completely and effectively waived all such rights and irrevocably granted you the right to grant the licenses stated above without the need for payment to you or any other person or entity; (ii) you have obtained permission from any individuals that the User Content relate to in order for Company to use, and grant others the right to use, User Content in accordance with the Terms without the need for payment to you or any other person or entity; and (iii) the User Content does not (a) contain false or misleading information, (b) infringe on the intellectual property, privacy, publicity, statutory, contractual or other rights of any third party, (c) contain any libelous, defamatory, obscene, offensive, threatening or otherwise harassing or hateful content, or (d) contain computer viruses, worms or other harmful files. Upon request by Company, you will furnish Company any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms. You are solely responsible for the User Content and you hereby agree to indemnify and hold Company and its employees, agents, affiliates, assigns and licensees harmless from any and all damages, claims, expenses, costs or fees arising from or in connection with a breach of any of the foregoing representations or your violation of any law or rights of a third party. If you are submitting User Content as a landlord, financial service provider, wireless carrier or any retailer providing consumer products or services, you agree, represent and warrant that you are submitting User Content in compliance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). Company is not liable for any actions or omissions of any party submitting User Content, including actions and omissions of landlord, financial service provider, wireless carrier and any retailer.
                You authorize your landlord, wireless operator and any other third party providing services to you to disclose to Company and its affiliates personal and financial information about you, including your name, number, email address, rent payment, billing and payment information and account status (such information to be considered User Content). You further authorize Company to disclose or report any User Content or any other information collected in connection with the Services to credit reporting agencies and other third parties. Any late payments, missed payments or other defaults on accounts, including rental or wireless carrier accounts, reported to us may be reflected in your credit report.  Once payments have been reported by Company to a credit reporting agency, the reporting of those payments cannot be modified, amended or canceled, unless otherwise permitted by law, and the cessation of the reporting any payments to a credit reporting agency may negatively impact your credit history. Company shall not be liable for any claims, charges, demands, damages or adverse impacts on your credit score or credit history if you cease using the Services or the Services are no longer available to you, whether or not Company is at fault. Notwithstanding the above, any party may dispute any entry on a credit report provided by Company to a credit reporting agency pursuant to the FCRA.
                If Company determines that any User Content is inaccurate, it may request that you update the User Content or may update the User Content without liability to you or consent from you. At Company’s sole discretion, any User Content may be included in the Services in whole or in part in modified form without liability to you. In addition, Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or remove any User Content that is available or submitted via the Services that violates these Terms. Notwithstanding anything here, Company is not responsible for detecting or correcting any errors and you acknowledge that the accuracy and completeness of  User Content you submit to Company is your sole responsibility. Under no circumstances will Company be liable in any way for any User Content submitted by you.
                Company is an independent company not related to any credit reporting agency, and the Company is not responsible for how any credit reporting agency may manage or use the information provided to them. You hereby agree to hold Company harmless against any such claims (all subject to the FCRA and the Credit Reporting Dispute Resolution Policy. Please consult the credit reporting agency for the terms and conditions of how they collect, store, manage, use, modify, disseminate and distribute such information. Once the User Content is transmitted from Company to the credit reporting agency, that credit reporting agency will obtain an ownership interest in that User Content.
                You also authorize Company and its affiliates to obtain from third parties, public bodies or credit reporting agencies any information required to verify your identity or any information or User Content reported to Company or provide Services to you. This may include verification of any reported payments or agreements between you and a third party (e.g., landlord, wireless carrier, etc.). Company may also require you to verify contact information and any financial accounts related to or accessed using the Services. If Company is unable to verify your information, it may deny Service to you.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Company or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

                Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
                9. Limitation of Liability
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Company, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this service. Under no circumstances will Company be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account, User Content, or the information contained therein.
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Company assumes no liability or responsibility for any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content or User Content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information or User Content stored therein; (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (vi) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (vii) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

                This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.
                Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
                The Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States and is only intended for use in the United States.

You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.
                10. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
                   1. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Los Angeles, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
                   2. Arbitration. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Company. For any dispute with Company, you agree to first contact us at team@hatch.credit and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise.
