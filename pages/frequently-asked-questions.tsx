You can also use Perch for other purposes, like maintaining your savings goals and tracking expenses. Plus, you can expect us to continue rolling out improvements and features, so why not stick around?  "

          title="Someone else (a guarantor) pays for my rent. Can I still improve my credit score?"
          text="As long as your rent is being paid with funds from your bank account, you can still improve your credit score. For example, if your guarantor transfers rent money into your account every month and you use that money to pay your rent, we can still report these recurring payments. If you pay your rent directly from your guarantors bank account, then we can't report that as your data to credit bureaus.
