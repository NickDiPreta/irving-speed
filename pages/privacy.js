              or in connection with our Service, on other devices you may use,
              and on other websites, apps, or services. Typically, though not
              always, the information we share is provided through cookies or
              similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are
              using and collect information, including click stream information,
              browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other
              information. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer
              that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the
              Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
              Services, including helping us analyze Services usage more
              accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your
              browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to
              remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit
              to the Site. We and our third-party partners use this information

              interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such
              as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. We, or
              our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that
              content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising
              on another device. We do this by collecting information about each
              device you use when you are logged in to our Service. We may also
              work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or
              the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two
              or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may
              share a common account identifier (such as an email address or
              user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize
              you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this
              cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other
              personalized content to you across your devices, to perform
              analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising
              campaigns. We may use Google Analytics to recognize you and link
              the devices you use when you visit our site or Service on your
              browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our Service,
              or otherwise engage with us. We may share a unique identifier,
              like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate
              the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how
              our users interact with our Service and to tailor our
              advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google

              purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements, which
              may include reselling this information to additional third
